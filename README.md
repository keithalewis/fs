# Financial System

The financial world is complicated but has identifiable components that interact under well-defined rules.

Legal entities trade instruments over time and account for positions and associated cash flows.
In addition to marking-to-market and profit and loss there are fees and taxes.
Managing risk involves models of what can happen in the future and how
dynamic trading can tailor future cash flows.

## Who

### Issuers

Financial _securities_ are issued by companies to raise capital.

An _initial public offering_ provides _stock shares_ of a company to investors.
Stock holders have some say in how the company operates and receive dividends decided by the company.

Companies can also raise capital by issuing _bonds_. Investors hand over a _notional_
amount and receive periodic _coupons_. When the bond _matures_ they get their last
coupon plus notional. Bond holders have no say in how the company operates but
in the event of default they get first priority on the proceeds from liquidation.

### Investors

Buy and sell instruments. Pay money to people who help them do that.

### Intermediaries

Exchange, Broker, OTC.

### Obligations

The issuer has to pay coupons, dividends, margin. The investor pays broker/exchange fees, borrow cost, tax.
