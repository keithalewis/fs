# Financial System

The financial world is complicated but has identifiable components that interact under well-defined rules.

Legal entities trade instruments over time. Trades accumulate to positions
involving cash flows. Positions are marked-to-market to determine profit and loss.

Some cash flows are a function of the instrument issuer. Stocks have dividends,
bonds have coupons, futures have margin accounts. There are also
ancillary cash flows such as broker fees and taxes.

Managing risk involves models of what can happen in the future and how
dynamic trading can tailor future cash flows.

## Who

### Issuer

Financial _securities_ are issued by companies to raise capital.

An _initial public offering_ provides _stock shares_ of a company to investors.
Stock holders have some say in how the company operates and receive dividends decided by the company.

Companies can also raise capital by issuing _bonds_. Investors hand over a _notional_
amount and receive periodic _coupons_. When the bond _matures_ they get their last
coupon plus notional. Bond holders have no say in how the company operates but
in the event of default they get first priority on the proceeds from liquidation.

### Broker

_Brokers_ connect buyers with sellers and charge a fee for that service.
_Broker-dealers_ hold an inventory of the securities they offer and have
_market exposure_ to the change in value of the positions they hold.

### Exchange 

_Exchanges_ connect liquidity providers with investors
and get paid a percentage of the volume that is traded.

### Investor

_Investors_ buy and sell instruments. They decide how much of each instrument
they are willing to trade at the current market price.
